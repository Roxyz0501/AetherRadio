On 2026-10-03 the user explicitly requested publication after being informed that
in-game playback/lock/restore testing was outstanding. Publish as an initial preview
with that limitation documented, after release packaging and public URL checks.
This does not change the recorded standalone classification.

0.1.1.0: user-requested movable mini player, LUNE-inspired appearance, expansion/genre tabs,
continuous scrolling and readable unknown titles. 21 managed/offline checks and isolated
ImGui interaction tests passed. Audio control is unchanged; no packet send code added.

0.1.2.0: replaced system-config writes with a transient BGM bus multiplier.
33 managed/offline checks and isolated ImGui volume interactions passed. Public
ZIP hash, author, URLs and license verified. Live listening remains unverified.
Seeking remains unsupported by the current native playback backend; a separate
playback engine was proposed; the user subsequently declined seeking on 2026-10-04.

0.1.3.0: display name BGMPlayer and /bgmplayer primary command. Existing AetherRadio
InternalName, assembly and config identity retained for in-place updates. Commands
now reveal the window on screen and focus it; legacy command remains available.
Release build, 24 managed checks and command/UI harness passed. Public main and
commit-pinned indexes, repository/icon/download and packaged identity verified.
Actual execution of the new command in the running game remains unverified.

0.1.4.0: logout resets selection, queue/history, elapsed time and playback errors,
releases/disposes native hooks and restores transient BGM volume. Next manual
play creates a fresh engine; persistent playlists/settings are unchanged.
44 managed checks, 53 including offline catalogue checks, and the command/UI
harness passed. Clean Release build, public repository/icon/ZIP, packaged
identity/license, SHA-256 and both shared index URLs verified. Native in-game
logout/relogin and audio restoration remain unverified.
